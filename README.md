# SMCA Front End - SecureComm Defense Prototype

This is a demo React + Vite + Tailwind frontend for the SecureComm Defense project.

## Quick start (locally)
1. Install Node 16+ and npm.
2. In project folder:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:5173

## Deploy
- Push to GitHub and connect to Vercel (auto-detect Vite).
- `vercel.json` included for static deploy routing.

## Notes
- This is a prototype. The "secure" encryption shown is mocked. Replace with proper E2EE (Signal/Olm/libsodium) before production.
